# Data Types in Go

- Go is a statically typed language, meaning each variable must be assigned a type and cannot be changed once assigned.
- Built-in data types:
  - `bool`: a simple true/false value
  - String: a collection of characters
  - Integers (fixed integer types):
    - Unsigned integers with a specified number of bits (e.g. uint8, uint16)
    - Assigned integers with a specified number of bits (e.g. int8, int16)
  - Type aliases:
  - `byte`: an alias for `uint8`
  - `unsigned int`, `int`: data types that reflect either 32 or 64 bit values depending on the operating system
  - `unsigned int pointer`, `int pointer`: pointers to `uint` and `int` values, respectively
- Floating-point types:
  - `float32`: a 32-bit floating-point value
  - `float64`: a 64-bit floating-point value
- Complex types:
  - `complex64`: a complex number with 64-bit real and imaginary parts
  - `complex128`: a complex number with 128-bit real and imaginary parts
- Built-in data collection types:
  - Arrays: manage order data collections
  - Slices: manage order data collections
  - Maps (dictionaries): manage key-value pairs
  - Structs: manage aggregations of values
- Language organization types:
  - Functions: a type that can be passed as an argument to another function
  - Interfaces: a type that defines a contract or set of methods
  - Channels: a type that allows for communication between goroutines
